A reusable football player statistics component.

# Setup Instructions

Install Live SASS Compiler from the VS Code extension store to compile SASS files to CSS live: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass

After that's installed, you may need to restart your VS Code application to see a 'Watch My Sass' button appear in the bar at the bottom of the screen. When you can see that option, click it and CSS will automatically be generated from the Sass input file.
